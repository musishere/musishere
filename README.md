### 👋 About Me

I’m a software engineer with hands-on experience building **production-grade web applications** and **scalable cloud infrastructure**.

My focus is not just writing code, but designing systems that are:
- **Reliable under load**
- **Cost-efficient on the cloud**
- **Easy to deploy, monitor, and evolve**

I work across the stack — from APIs and databases to CI/CD pipelines and infrastructure automation — with a strong bias toward **clarity, simplicity, and scalability**.

---

### 🧑‍💻 What I Actually Do

- Design and build **backend-heavy applications** (Node.js / TypeScript)
- Architect and deploy systems on **AWS (EC2, RDS, Lambda, S3, IAM)**
- Automate infrastructure using **Terraform & CloudFormation**
- Build **CI/CD pipelines** for reliable deployments
- Work with **relational & NoSQL databases**, including geospatial workloads
- Apply **system-design principles** for scalability and fault tolerance
